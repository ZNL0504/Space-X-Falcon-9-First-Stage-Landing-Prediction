# Space-X-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Applied Data Science Capstone  

by Zhinan Li
*******************************
## Project Overview
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 
In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. 
The following is an example of a successful and launch.

## Project Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Data collection through SpaceX API
- Data collection through wiki page web scraping
### 2. Data wrangling
- Prepare Data for Machine Learning Model Building
- Determine Training Labels
### 3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Data summary with SQL
### 4. Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
- Launch Site location interactive map analysis with Folium
- Interactive dashboard with Poltly Dash
### 5. Predictive analysis using classification models
- Train Logistic Regression, SVM, Tree Decision classifier, KNN models
- Use `GridSearchCV` to conduct hyper parameter tunning
### 6. Data finding final report
- Compile all of above steps into one place 
- Deliver data-driven insights to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully
